          This is a simple web application built using React.js, Node.js and
          Express.js. This application is built to fetch scores, learn about
          teams (fun facts and trivia), and betting odds of live games.

              I used The Odds API to fetch sport data of upcoming and scores. In the future, I will display winning odds of each game that is set to play.

              For the ticketing information, I integrated Seat Geek&apos;s API to retrieve data from which team is playing, where and what day. You can even use links generated to purchase tickets from Seat Geek.

              For the players on each team page, I made an API that will call depending on which team is being loaded. From there, I have it linked to Wikipedia pages for each player that is called. If you wanted to follow a specific team&apos;s social media, I have them listed on each of their pages!

              Google Maps API was used to gather where each arena for a team was and plotted the facility with a simple query with a given arena name. Used their main documentation located at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/quickstart. I used the embeded api since it is free with an api key.
